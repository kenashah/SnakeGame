# SnakeGame
This is an Arduino-based game, which uses the Adafruit Joystick and LCD screen. The game is based on the classic
Snake game, which involves a "snake" controlled by the jostick movement; the user can control the movement of the snake,
and has to catch apples that appear on the screen in random positions. The snake will grow in size as the number of 
apples caught increase, and at the end the high scores are displayed. The game will end if the user hits one of the edges
of the screen, or if the snake runs into its own tail.
